# hello-world
This is me reading the guide and creating my first repository.

this is me now adding the first commit after having blatantly pressend enter naively thinking it would not add a 3rd line automatically added.
Now that isee how it works, it makes me happy.
Now i wonder in which language i type, or which type of rules it has.
Now i think over my head because i just started python yesterday and i should not think i'm a code god.You a re witnessing the verry beginning of my journey in coding.
This community looks great and i already like the guide.
Bye.
La Li Le Lu Le Lo.
